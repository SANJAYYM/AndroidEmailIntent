attached to the intent before sending the intent to a target email client. You can use following extra fields in your email:

      EXTRA_HTML_TEXT --A constant String that is associated with the Intent, used with ACTION_SEND to   
                          supply an alternative to EXTRA_TEXT as HTML formatted text.
      EXTRA_SUBJECT   -- A constant string holding the desired subject line of a message. 
      EXTRA_TEXT      --  A constant CharSequence that is associated with the Intent, used with **ACTION_SEND**  
                         to supply the literal data to be sent.
